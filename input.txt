I wanna be the very best;
Like no one ever was;
To catch them is my real test;
To train them is my cause;
I will travel across the land;
Searching far and wide;
Each Pokemon to understand;
The power that's inside;
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all;
Its you and me;
I know it's my destiny;
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend;
In a world we must defend;
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all;
A heart so true;
Our courage will pull us through;
You teach me and I'll teach you;
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all;
Gotta catch 'em all;
;
Yeah;
;
Every challenge along the way;
With courage I will face;
I will battle every day;
To claim my rightful place;
Come with me, the time is right;
There's no better team;
Arm in arm we'll win the fight;
It's always been our dream;
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all;
Its you and me;
I know it's my destiny;
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend;
In a world we must defend;
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all;
A heart so true;
Our courage will pull us through;
You teach me and I'll teach you;
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all;
Gotta catch 'em all;
Gotta catch 'em all;
Gotta catch 'em all;
Yeah;
;
This was a triumph;
I'm making a note here: "HUGE SUCCESS";
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction;
Aperture Science;
We do what we must because we can;
For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead;
But there's no sense crying over every mistake;
You just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake;
And the Science gets done;
And you make a neat gun;
For the people who are still alive;
I'm not even angry;
I'm being so sincere right now;
Even though you broke my heart;
And killed me and tore me to pieces;
And threw every piece into a fire;
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you;
Now these points of data make a beautiful line;
And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time;
So I'm glad I got burned;
Think of all the things we learned;
For the people who are still alive;
Go ahead and leave me;
I think I prefer to stay inside;
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you;
Maybe Black Mesa;
That was a joke, haha, fat chance;
Anyway, this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist;
Look at me still talking when there's Science to do;
When I look out there, it makes me glad I'm not you;
I've experiments to run;
There is research to be done;
On the people who are still alive;
And believe me I am still alive;
I'm doing science and I'm still alive;
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive;
While you're dying I'll be still alive;
And when you're dead I will be still alive;
Still alive, still alive;

Oh, my, God Becky, look at her butt ;
It is so big, she looks like;
One of those rap guys' girlfriends;
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys? ;
They only talk to her, because, ;
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay? ;
I mean, her butt, is just so big ;
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there;
I mean gross, look;
She's just so, black;
;
I like big butts and I can not lie;
You other brothers can't deny;
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist;
And a round thing in your face;
You get sprung, want to pull up tough;
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed;
Deep in the jeans she's wearing;
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring;
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha ;
And take your picture;
My homeboys tried to warn me;
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny);
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin;
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me ;
'Cause you ain't that average groupie;
I've seen her dancin' ;
To hell with romancin';
She's sweat, wet, ;
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette;
I'm tired of magazines;
Sayin' flat butts are the thing;
Take the average black man and ask him that;
She gotta pack much back;
So, fellas (Yeah) Fellas (Yeah);
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah);
Tell 'em to shake it (Shake it) Shake it (Shake it);
Shake that healthy butt;
Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty);
;
Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty);
;
I like 'em round, and big;
And when I'm throwin' a gig;
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal;
Now here's my scandal;
I want to get you home;
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh;
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy;
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys;
I want 'em real thick and juicy;
So find that juicy double;
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble;
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble;
So I'm lookin' at rock videos;
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes;
You can have them bimbos;
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo;
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya;
I won't cuss or hit ya;
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck;
Til the break of dawn;
Baby got it goin' on;
A lot of simps won't like this song;
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it;
And I'd rather stay and play;
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong;
And I'm down to get the friction on;
So, ladies (yeah) Ladies (yeah);
If you want to role in my Mercedes (yeah);
Then turn around, stick it out;
Even white boys got to shout;
Baby got back;
;
Baby got back;
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females;
Cosmo ain't got nothin' ;
To do with my selection ;
Thirty six-twenty four- thirty six ;
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3;
;
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda;
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda;
My anaconda don't want none ;
Unless you've got buns, hon;
You can do side bends or sit-ups ;
But please don't lose that butt;
Some brothers want to play that hard role ;
And tell you that the butt ain't gol';
So they toss it and leave it;
And I pull up quick to retrieve it;
So Cosmo says you're fat;
Well I ain't down with that;
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin';
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin';
To the beanpole dames in the magazines;
You ain't it, Miss Thing;
Give me a sista, I can't resist her;
Red beans and rice didn't miss her;
Some knucklehead tried to dis;
'Cause his girls are on my list;
He had game but he chose to hit 'em;
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em;
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down;
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT;
And kick them nasty thoughts;
Baby got back;
;
Baby got back;
;
I've been staring at the edge of the water;
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why;
I wish I could be the perfect daughter;
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try;
Every turn I take, every trail I track;
Every path I make, every road leads back;
To the place I know, where I can not go, where I long to be;
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me;
And no one knows, how far it goes;
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me;
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go;
I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island;
Everything is by design;
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island;
So maybe I can roll with mine;
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong;
I'll be satisfied if I play along;
But the voice inside sings a different song;
What is wrong with me?
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding;
But no one knows, how deep it goes;
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me;
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
The line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me;
And no one knows, how far it goes;
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me;
One day I'll know, how far I'll go;
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight;
Not a footprint to be seen.
A kingdom of isolation,
and it looks like I'm the Queen;
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside;
Couldn't keep it in;
Heaven knows I've tried;
Don't let them in,
don't let them see;
Be the good girl you always have to be;
Conceal, don't feel,
don't let them know;
Well now they know;
Let it go, let it go;
Can't hold it back anymore;
Let it go, let it go;
Turn away and slam the door;
I don't care;
what they're going to say;
Let the storm rage on.
The cold never bothered me anyway;
It's funny how some distance;
Makes everything seem small;
And the fears that once controlled me;
Can't get to me at all;
It's time to see what I can do;
To test the limits and break through;
No right, no wrong, no rules for me,
I'm free!
Let it go, let it go;
I am one with the wind and sky;
Let it go, let it go;
You'll never see me cry;
Here I stand;
And here I'll stay;
Let the storm rage on;
My power flurries through the air into the ground;
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around;
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast;
I'm never going back, the past is in the past;
Let it go, let it go;
And I'll rise like the break of dawn;
Let it go, let it go;
That perfect girl is gone;
Here I stand;
In the light of day;
Let the storm rage on;
The cold never bothered me anyway!
;
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor;
Angelica Schuyler!
;
A toast to the groom!
(To the groom!);
(To the groom!);
{(To the groom!)};
To the bride!
{To the bride!};
(To the bride!);
{To the bride!};
From your sister;
(Angelica!);
(Angelica!);
{(Angelica!)};
Who is always by your side;
(By your side);
{By your side};
To your union;
{(To the union!)};
{(To the revolution!)};
And the hope that you provide;
(You provide!);
{(You provide!)};
May you always...
{(Always)};
Be satisfied;
;
I remember that night, I just might;
Regret that night for the rest of my days;
I remember those soldier boys;
Tripping over themselves to win our praise;
I remember that dreamlike candlelight;
Like a dream that you can't quite place;
But Alexander, I'll never forget the first time I saw your face;
I have never been the same;
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame;
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name;
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame;
This is not a game...
;
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied;
I'm sure I don't know what you mean;
You forget yourself;
You're like me;
I'm never satisfied;
Is that right?
I've never been satisfied;
My name is Angelica Schuyler;
Alexander Hamilton;
Where's your fam'ly from?
Unimportant;
There's a million things I haven't done but;
Just you wait, just you wait...
;
So so so... so this is what it feels like to match wits;
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch?
It's the feeling of freedom, of seein' the light;
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes;
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's;
A dream and it's a bit of a dance;
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance;
He's a bit of a flirt, but I'mma give it a chance;
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants;
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place;
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is...
;
Helpless...
And I know she is...
Helpless...
And her eyes are just...
Helpless...
And I realize;
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time...
;
Where are you taking me?
I'm about to change your life;
Then by all means, lead the way;
;
Number one!
I'm a girl in a world in which;
My only job is to marry rich;
My father has no sons so I'm the one;
Who has to social climb for one;
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in;
New York City is insidious;
And Alexander is penniless;
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less;
;
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you;
Schuyler?
My sister;
;
Number two!
He's after me 'cause I'm a Schuyler sister;
That elevates his status, I'd;
Have to be naïve to set that aside;
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza;
Now that's his bride;
Nice going, Angelica, he was right;
You will never be satisfied;
;
Thank you for all your service;
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it;
I'll leave you to it;
;
Number three!
I know my sister like I know my own mind;
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind;
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned;
He'd be mine;
She would say, "I'm fine.";
She'd be lying;
;
But when I fantasize at night;
It's Alexander's eyes;
As I romanticize what might;
Have been if I hadn't sized;
Him up so quickly;
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life...
;
To the groom!
(To the groom!);
(To the groom!);
{(To the groom!)};
To the bride!
{To the bride!};
(To the bride!);
{To the bride!};
From your sister;
(Angelica!);
(Angelica!);
{(Angelica!)};
Who is always by your side;
(By your side);
{By your side};
To your union;
{(To the union!)};
{(To the revolution!)};
And the hope that you provide;
(You provide!);
{(You provide!)};
May you always...
{(Always)};
Be satisfied;
(Be satisfied);
{Be satisfied};
(Be satisfied);
And I know;
{(Be satisfied)};
(Be satisfied);
(Be satisfied);
(Be satisfied);
She'll be happy as;
(Be satisfied);
(Be satisfied);
His bride;
{(Be satisfied)};
And I know;
(Be satisfied);
(Be satisfied);
(Be satisfied);
{Be satisfied};
He will never be satisfied;
I will never be satisfied;
;

He's got hair like Gretzky;
And he does jumps on his skateboard;
I hope he asks me out;
Takes me to my favorite spot;
It'll be just him and me;
(But don't forget the robot);
Dad says I'm too young to date (Lame!);

Everybody come and play;

;
I went to the mall with a couple of friends;
I had a whole week's allowance to spend;
I want hoop earrings and a Benetton shirt;
We came here to shop and we came here to flirt;
I turned around and who should I see;
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney;
He said, "Young lady, I don't approve.";
So I had to get down and bust a crazy move;
Hit it Fred, come on;
Let's go to the mall;
Let's go to the mall, everybody!
Everybody come and play;
Throw every last care away;
Let's go to the mall today;
