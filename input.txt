I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Its you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Yeah
Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place
Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Its you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Yeah
This was a triumph
I'm making a note here: "HUGE SUCCESS"
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Aperture Science
We do what we must because we can
For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead
But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake
And the Science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive
I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me and tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you
Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive
Go ahead and leave me
I think I prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
Maybe Black Mesa
That was a joke, haha, fat chance
Anyway, this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist
Look at me still talking when there's Science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are still alive
And believe me I am still alive
I'm doing science and I'm still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
While you're dying I'll be still alive
And when you're dead I will be still alive
Still alive, still alive

Oh, my, God Becky, look at her butt 
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys? 
They only talk to her, because, 
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay? 
I mean, her butt, is just so big 
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black

I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha 
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me 
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin' 
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet, 
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (Yeah) Fellas (Yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (Shake it) Shake it (Shake it)
Shake that healthy butt
Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (yeah) Ladies (yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back

Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' 
To do with my selection 
Thirty six-twenty four- thirty six 
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none 
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups 
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role 
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back

Baby got back

I've been staring at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go, where I long to be
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
The line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen.
A kingdom of isolation,
and it looks like I'm the Queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in;
Heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in,
don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel,
don't let them know
Well now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care
what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on.
The cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me,
I'm free!
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand
In the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway!
Hey hey hey hey

Oh, I do I do I do I (Hey hey hey hey)
Dooo! Hey! (Hey hey hey hey)
Oh, I do I do I do I (Hey hey hey hey)
Dooo! Boy you got me (Hey hey hey)

Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in 'em

I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

Grab my sister and whisper, "Yo, this one's mine." (Ooh)
My sister made her way across the room to you (Ooh)
And I got nervous, thinking, "What's she gonna do?" (Ooh)
She grabs you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through" (Ooh)
Then you look back at me, and suddenly I'm...

Helpless!
Oh, look at those eyes (Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit)
Oh! Yeah, I'm helpless, I know
(Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em)
(I'm helpless!)
I'm so into you, I am so into you
(Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit)
(I'm helpless!)
I know I'm down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

Where are you taking me?

I'm about to change your life

Then by all means, lead the way

Elizabeth Schuyler
It's a pleasure to meet you

Schuyler?

My sister

Thank you for all your service

If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

I'll leave you to it

One week later

I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, 'cause she wants to form a harem

I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him

Ha!
Two weeks later in the living room stressin' (stressin')
My father's stone-faced while you're asking for his blessin' (blessin')
I'm dying inside, as you wine and dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry 'cause there's nothing that your mind can't do (Ooh)

My father makes his way across the room to you (Ooh)
I panic for a second, thinking, "We're through." (Ooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says, "Be true." (Ooh)
And you turn back to me smiling, and I'm...

(Hey!)
Helpless!
(Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit)
I'm helpless, hoo
(Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em I'm helpless!)
Yes mommy, that boy is mine
(Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit)
(I'm helpless!)
Helpless!
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so...

{Helpless!} (I do I do I do I do!) Eliza...
{Helpless!} (I do I do I do I do!) I've never felt so
{Helpless!} (Hey, yeah, yeah!)
{Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em}
(Down for the count and I'm)
My life is gon' be fine 'cause Eliza's in it {Helpless!}
(I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit)
{Helpless!}
(I'm) {Helpless!}
{Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em}

In New York you can be a new man
In New York you can be a new man
In New York you can be a new man

Helpless
