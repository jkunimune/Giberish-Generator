I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Its you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Yeah
Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place
Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Its you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Yeah
This was a triumph
I'm making a note here: "HUGE SUCCESS"
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Aperture Science
We do what we must because we can
For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead
But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake
And the Science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive
I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me and tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you
Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive
Go ahead and leave me
I think I prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
Maybe Black Mesa
That was a joke, haha, fat chance
Anyway, this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist
Look at me still talking when there's Science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are still alive
And believe me I am still alive
I'm doing science and I'm still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
While you're dying I'll be still alive
And when you're dead I will be still alive
Still alive, still alive
